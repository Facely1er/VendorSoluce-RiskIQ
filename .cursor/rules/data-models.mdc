## Core Data Models

### Vendor Entity
Key attributes:
- Strategic/Operational/Tactical classification
- Risk tier mapping (Critical ≥80, High ≥60, Medium ≥40, Low <40)
- Data sensitivity classification (PII/PHI/Financial)
- Contract value brackets (>500k, >100k, base)
- Assessment history tracking

### Assessment Framework
Structured templates for:
- NIST compliance evaluation
- SOC2 assessment criteria  
- GDPR requirements
- ISO27001 controls
- HIPAA compliance checks

### Asset Management
Relationships and attributes:
- Asset criticality levels
- Data classification types
- Vendor relationship mappings
- Access level controls
- Integration risk factors

### Tier-Based Controls
Feature access matrices:
```
Free Tier:
