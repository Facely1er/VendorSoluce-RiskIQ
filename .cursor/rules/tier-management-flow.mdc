## Core Tier Management Components

### Subscription Model
Located in `/src/services/tierService.ts`:

- Three-tier product structure:
  - Free Tier
  - Pro Tier ($149)
  - Enterprise Tier ($449)

### Feature Gates
Implemented through tier-specific matrices:
```javascript
{
  free: {
    maxVendors: 5,
    maxAssessments: 10,
    templates: ['NIST_BASIC'],
    features: ['CSV_EXPORT_WATERMARK']
  },
  pro: {
    unlimited: ['vendors', 'assessments'],
    templates: ['NIST', 'SOC2', 'GDPR', 'ISO27001', 'HIPAA'],
    features: ['PDF_EXPORT', 'JSON_EXPORT']
  },
  enterprise: {
    includes: ['WHITE_LABEL', 'PRIORITY_SUPPORT'],
    unlimited: true
  }
}
```

### Usage Tracking System
Located in `/src/services/usageTrackingService.ts`:

- Monthly SBOM analysis quota tracking
- Rolling usage windows for assessment counts
- Tier-specific limitation enforcement
- Usage reset management for billing cycles

### Document Generation Controls
White-labeling and export controls based on tier:
- Free: Watermarked CSV exports
- Pro: PDF and JSON exports without watermarks
- Enterprise: Custom branding options

### Template Access Rights
Assessment framework availability by tier:
- Free: Basic NIST template
- Pro: Full framework library
- Enterprise: Custom template creation

The tier management flow implements sophisticated subscription control, usage tracking, and feature gating specific to vendor risk management requirements. Feature access is progressively unlocked through subscription tiers while maintaining strict usage quotas and document generation controls.
