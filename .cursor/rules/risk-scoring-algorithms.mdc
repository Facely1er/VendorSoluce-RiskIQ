## Core Risk Calculation Components

### Vendor Categorization Weights
- Strategic vendors: +30 weight
- Operational vendors: +20 weight
- Tactical vendors: +10 weight

### Contract Value Risk Tiers
- Over $500k: +25 points
- Over $100k: +15 points  
- Under $100k: +5 points

### Data Sensitivity Scoring
- PII/PHI data access: +20 points
- Financial data access: +20 points
- Assessment recency impact:
  - Over 180 days: +15 penalty
  - Over 90 days: +10 penalty
  - Current assessment: -10 bonus

### Risk Level Thresholds
- Critical Risk: ≥80 points
- High Risk: ≥60 points
- Medium Risk: ≥40 points  
- Low Risk: <40 points

### Category-Specific Risk Weights
- Security controls: 40% of total score
- Compliance status: 30% of total score
- Financial health: 20% of total score
- Operational resilience: 10% of total score

### Industry-Specific Assessment Templates
- NIST SP 800-161 compliance scoring
- SOC2 control evaluation weights
- GDPR compliance risk factors
- HIPAA security rule scoring
- ISO27001 control mapping weights

### Risk Score Calculation Formula
Final Risk Score = 
  (Category Weight * 0.3) +
  (Contract Value Risk * 0.25) +
  (Data Sensitivity Score * 0.25) +
  (Assessment Recency Impact * 0.2)

Maximum possible score: 100 points
